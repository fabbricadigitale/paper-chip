[email](mailto:l.didonato@fabbricadigitale.it), or any other method with the owners and the maintainers of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Commit convention

We use the **eslint** commit convention.

You should read more about is [here](https://github.com/conventional-changelog-archived-repos/conventional-changelog-eslint/blob/master/convention.md).

Anyway here are some good commit message summary examples:

```
Build: Update Travis to only test Node 0.10 (refs #734)
Fix: Semi rule incorrectly flagging extra semicolon (fixes #840)
Upgrade: Esprima to 1.2, switch to using Esprima comment attachment (fixes #730)
```

## How to contribute

We want you to **work on something you love**.

So, after discussing the changes, the new feature, or the improvements to this project, **fork** this repository, create a **feature branch** (eg., `feature/awesome-feature`), and start **coding** !

The contribution process is driven via **pull requests**.

Do not forget to:

1. update the README.md (and generally any **documentation**) with details of eventual **changes to the interface**.

2. update **test suites** related to the feature you are contributing.

3. (please) follow our **commit conventions** (read more about them [above](#commit-convention)) and make sure all of your **commits** are **atomic** (ie., one feature per commit)

4. write a **clear**, **concise**, but **communicative one-line commit message** for small changes

5. write multi-line messages for bigger changes - eg.,

    ```
    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
    ```

6. verify your code style matches the rules of this repository by the provided **lint** task

7. send a **pull request** containing a clear list of what you have done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests))

8. once you have the evaluation and the sign-off of two other developers your changes will be merged within the repository
